Voted &quot;Best in the Capital /Saratoga Region&quot;, The Morgan State House is an inn in the European tradition. It is centrally located in downtown Albany, on a quiet, tree-lined residential street overlooking Washington Park and was the longtime home of the artist and suffragette Alice Morgan Wright (1881&mdash;1975), who lived here from 1888 (when she was 7 years old) until her death. The house was designed by R.W. Gibson, the architect of the Cathedral of All Saints, for her father, Henry Romeyn Wright, who made a fortune in dry goods during the Civil War. The multiple peaked gables and intricate interior details reflect the Japanese-influenced aesthetic of the 1880s. Alice Morgan Wright was a leading figure in the American suffrage movement and once was jailed in London with Emmeline Pankhurst. In 1921 she helped found the New York League of Women’s Voters. An influential artist of the Art Deco style, Wright maintained a studio on the fourth floor of the house, and her works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the country.",

    "content": "The Eldorado, a former ''maison de rendez-vous'', was once home to the kept women of the 19th century bourgeois. Now a very cute ''no'' star hotel, its charm more than makes up for what it lacks in amenities (who needs a TV in Paris anyway?). The  staff are super friendly, the décor is garage sale chic, and there's a lovely courtyard that fills with neighbourhood hipsters on warm evenings. It also has a very good location and you can easily avoid the noise of Pigalle or Montmartre's high prices, but they're within stumble distance if you decide to explore. For early risers breakfast (€5, until 10:00) is served in the attached restaurant/bar. Some English spoken, especially for those who pet the cat sprawled across the reception desk.",

The gate to Frijoles Canyon closes for the night at sundown and opens at 7AM, the entrance to this campground is just before the gate. There is a 24-hour paystation close to the entrance to pay camping fees (not entrance fees).  The station accepts cash and most credit cards using a do-it-yourself keypad and credit card reader. After dark, its lights turn on automatically when someone approaches the station. Campsite fees are good until 12 noon, more than a single day can be paid for at one time.  First-come, first-serve, no reservations. 94 sites, no hook-ups, but centrally-located water taps and a dump station are available.  Each site has a paved parking pad, picnic table and fire grill. Parking pads, picnic tables and tent sites are nearly all sloped, a few pieces of 2 inch x 6 inch slabs of wood will usually prove helpful in levelling vehicles and picnic tables.  During extreme fire hazard conditions building of fires in the grills may be prohibited. It is always a good idea to bring a fueled stove for cooking rather than to rely only on the possibility of building a fire in the grill. The restrooms have electrical outlets, flush toilets, sinks with hand soap dispensers, and special sanitary sinks to dump small portable toilets and gray water from dishwashing.  No showers (available for a fee at the public pool and the YMCA in Los Alamos, 12 miles/20&nbsp;km away).  Limit 10 people/2 vehicles/3 tents per site.  Firewood gathering is not permitted. Pets are permitted only in campsites, parking areas, or along roadways, and must be on leash.  Evening programs are offered at campground amphitheater in summer as staffing permits; check the bulletin boards on the restrooms.",

The water is white and is reputedly good to treat reuma. The whole onsen smells of sulfur from the water, which adds to the charm once you get used to it. The large bath is open 24 hours and is one of the few remaining mixed-sex baths (be warned!), except 8-9am and pm when it is female only. It is near a nice short walk that takes you to a termal-heated wooded bench. Serious hikers can relax in this onsen after walking the Hakoda mountain. Rooms are Japanese style, and food is served in the room, ryokan style. Alternatively you can stay for a longer period and cook your own food in the cooking facilities.",

Here, the Tourist Wharf and all the shops and attractions are just a short walk away—ask the knowledgeable owners for tips; they've lived in Percé their whole lives and know the town inside and out—but you can also just relax on the porch or, if it gets nippy, inside by the fireplace. Breakfast in the morning features homemade local favourites, such as blueberry pancakes and old-fashioned chopped pork ''creton''. There's free WiFi, and free parking in the driveway—or, if you've arrived on the '''Route Verte''', there's a shed out back to store your bike.",
